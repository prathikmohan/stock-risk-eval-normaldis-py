## stock-risk-eval-normaldis-py

We use daily resturns of stocks in BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) from BSE website (www.bseindia.com) to understand the risks and returns associated with two stocks- BEML and GLAXO, so that a future investor could use this data to make a better business decisions.

The dataset contains daily open and close price along with daily high and low prices, total trade quality, and turnover (in lakhs). We then explore the close price and do the daily returns calculation based on the previous day closing price.

The below questions are answered to help the investor make his decision:
1. What is the expected daily rate of return of these two stocks?
2. Which stocks have higher risk or volatility as far as daily returns are concerned?
3. Which stock has higher probablity of making a daily return of 2% or more?
4. Which stock has higher probablity of making a loss (risk) of 2% or more?

We use the concepts of normal distribution and descriptive statistics to achieve this task.
